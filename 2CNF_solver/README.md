## Task

The input is a Boolean formula in 2-CNF, given as a string of symbols. A *literal* is a variable name 
(at least any small Latin letter should be a legal variable name) or its negation, denoted by `~`.
A *clause* is either a literal, or `(L1 \/ L2)`, or `(L1 -> L2)`, where `L1` and `L2` are literals.
Finally, the *2-CNF* is either one clause or a conjunction of two or more clauses, where conjunction is
denoted by `/\`.

Example: `p /\ (p -> q) /\ (p -> ~r) /\ (~r \/ ~s) /\ (s \/ ~q)`

The *first* task is to check whether the given 2-CNF is satisfiable. The *second* task is, given a 2-CNF,
report that it is not satisfiable or return one of its satisfying assignments. Solving only the first task
gives you a half grade (2 points out of 4). Solving both gives 4 points.

### Technical Details

In order for the automated test to work fine, please carefully adhere the following technical instructions.
Your solution should be implemented in Python3, in a file named `boolean.py`. For the first task, you should
implement a function called `is_satisfiable`, which takes the string with the 2-CNF as an argument and
returns either `True` (satisfiable) or `False` (not satisfiable). The second task should be implemented as
a function called `sat_assignment`. This function also takes one argument (string) and returns an associative
array (dictionary) with the satifying assignment (e.g., `{ 'p': True, 'q': False, 'r': True }`) or `None`,
if the 2-CNF is not satisfiable.
